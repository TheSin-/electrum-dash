Description: Easy to use Terracoin client - Python module
 This package provides a lightweight Terracoin client which protects
 you from losing your TRC in a backup mistake or computer
 failure. Also, Terracoin Electrum does not require waiting time because it
 does not download the Terracoin blockchain.
 .
 This package provides the "electrum_trc" Python 3 module which can be used
 to access a Terracoin wallet from Python programs.

 .
 Features of Terracoin Electrum:
 .
   * Instant on: Your client does not download the blockchain. It uses a
     network of specialized servers that index the blockchain.
   * Forgiving: Your wallet can be recovered from a secret seed.
   * Safe: Your seed and private keys are encrypted on your hard drive.
     They are never sent to the servers.
   * Low trust: Information received from the servers is verified using
     SPV. Servers are authenticated using SSL.
   * No downtimes: Your client is not tied to a particular server; it
     will switch instantly if your server is down.
   * Ubiquitous: You can use the same wallet on different computers, they
     will synchronize automatically.
   * Cold Storage: Sign transactions from a computer that is always
     offline. Broadcast them using a machine that does not have your keys.
   * Reachable: You can export your private keys into other Terracoin
     clients.
   * Established: Terracoin Electrum is open source and was first released in
     November 2011.
